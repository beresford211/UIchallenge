## Project title
Toyota Research Institute Cloud UI Project

## Decision
  # Testing
    For testing I decided to use mocha and chai 

## Decision
  # User-Interface
    - Broke code down into modules (Voting, Utils, Functions to append elements to the dom ~ Script) 

    - I chose to dynamical update the UI by adding nodes with html, and css classes. In a production setting that isn't a great way to build websites but for this coding challenge I think it is a better representation of my skill set.

    - I chose to add specific containers for widgets like submittedBy, product description, and voting. This way if a team decides to change the format of the data or design the change will persist across the entire codebase.

  # Testing
    For testing I decided to use mocha and chai and render the test results in an html page.
